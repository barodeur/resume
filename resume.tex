\vspace*{2mm}

% {\textbf{Cross Cloud Kubernetes Cluster} \sl 2017 | SIDE PROJECT | Kubernetes, Terraform, CoreOS} \hfill DEMO\\
% I setup an immutable infrastructure to host the CI for my clients.
% It's a few bash scripts to add, remove and roll update servers to the cluster
% The Kubernetes stack is on top of a tinc VPN cluster that makes it a secure cross cloud setup.
% Top of that is a simple Gitlab with a few CI workers 
% \\

The main challenge was to identify scalability issues and fix them.
Most of those were solved by distributing tasks to a worker pool.\\
\vspace*{2mm}

{\textbf{Teltonica support for Anoloc} \sl 2015 | CLIENT PROJECT | IoT, golang} \hfill www.anoloc.fr\\
Anoloc was about to use a new tracking hardware on vehicles.
I implemented the server to receive UDP frames for the new Teltonika protocol.

{\textbf{Makesense, Future of Waste, Ecowork} \sl 2014 | CLIENT PROJECT | rails} \hfill\\
I maintained a Ruby on Rails platform for the Makesense project and helped terminate a project that was functionally similar.
Later, for a thrid project I factorized the many duplications of those three platforms into a Rails Engine in order
to accelerate the development of new white labels.
\vspace*{2mm}

{\textbf{Ray Ban Sales traning for Luxottica} \sl 2013 | CLIENT PROJECT | javascript, moodle} \hfill Private\\

{\textbf{Unilever Sustainable Living Lab} \sl 2012 | CLIENT PROJECT | rails, emberjs} \hfill Private\\
I helped a team at Tquila London (now Accenture) to customise a Discourse forum for Unilever needs.
This was challenging as Ember \& Discourse were not stable at the time. \\
I was also in charge of maintaining a second hosting solution in case we had any problems with Heroku EU zone (also beta).
My solution was a Chef managed cluster of Linodes.\\
\vspace*{2mm}

{\textbf{Voxe.org} \sl 2011 | CLIENT PROJECT | rails} \hfill www.voxe.org\\
I worked with Pierre Valade to develop a tool to compare political programs for the French Presidential election of 2012.

{\textbf{Wisemetrics} \sl 2011 | CLIENT PROJECT | rails, mongodb} \hfill www.wiselytics.com\\
I developed an advanced Facebook analytics platform to help content managers reach their audiences.

The product was later sold and became Wiselytics.\\
